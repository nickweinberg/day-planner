### Known Bugs
1.) If you add an event that occurs during the same time frame as two other
events AND it doesn't start before both events the events don't align
correctly and it is drawn underneath. 


#### Todo
1.) Clean up code.
2.) Refactor so everything isn't in global scope.
3.) Tests
4.) Update elements instead of redrawing everything everytime we add
something (redrawing everything is super expensive).
